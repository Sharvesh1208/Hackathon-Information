**Technical Do's and Don'ts for Uploading Code (Git & Hackathon):**

**Do:**

**Git:**
Do: Use descriptive commit messages that explain the changes you made.
Do: Regularly pull updates from the remote repository (git pull origin main) to stay in sync with your teammates' work.
Do: Consider using a .gitignore file to exclude unnecessary files (e.g., temporary files, IDE settings) from version control.
Do: Leverage Git commands like git status and git log to monitor changes and review history.

**Team Collaboration:**
Do: Communicate effectively with your team about code changes and branching strategies.
Do: Use pull requests to review and merge code changes before integrating them into the main branch.
Do: Resolve merge conflicts promptly to avoid delays.

**Hackathon Efficiency:**
Do: Set up your development environment beforehand to avoid wasting time during the hackathon.
Do: Test your code frequently to ensure functionality and catch bugs early.
Do: Leverage online resources and tutorials if you encounter unfamiliar technologies.

**Don't:**

**Git:**
Don't: Commit large binary files directly to the repository. Use Git Large File Storage (LFS) for such files.
Don't: Commit sensitive information like API keys or passwords to the repository.
Don't: Force push changes to the remote repository, as this can overwrite teammates' work. Discuss and resolve conflicts before pushing.
Don't: Wait until the last minute to push your code. Frequent pushes ensure backups and smoother collaboration.

**Team Collaboration:**
Don't: Work in isolation without communicating changes or collaborating on features.
Don't: Commit code directly to the main or master branch without proper review and merging through pull requests.
Don't: Leave merge conflicts unresolved for extended periods.

**Hackathon Efficiency:**
Don't: Spend excessive time learning a new technology from scratch during the hackathon. Focus on technologies your team is familiar with.
Don't: Neglect commenting and documenting your code, as this can lead to confusion for reviewers and future maintenance.
Don't: Be afraid to ask for help from other participants or online communities if you get stuck.
By following these Do's and Don'ts, your team can effectively utilize Git for collaborative coding throughout the hackathon, ensuring a smooth and successful code submission process.
